    <h2>About Shepard's Pie</h2>
    <p>Shepherd's Pie is a comforting and hearty dish that combines layers of savory goodness into one satisfying meal. Beginning with a base of seasoned ground lamb or beef cooked with onions, carrots, and peas, the filling is then simmered in a rich gravy that infuses every bite with deep, meaty flavor. Topped generously with creamy mashed potatoes, which are whipped to a velvety smoothness and baked until golden and crisp on the edges, Shepherd's Pie is the epitome of rustic comfort food. Each forkful offers a delightful contrast of textures and flavors, from the softness of the mashed potatoes to the heartiness of the meat filling. Perfect for a cozy family dinner or a gathering with friends, Shepherd's Pie warms both the body and the soul with its nostalgic appeal and robust taste.</p>
